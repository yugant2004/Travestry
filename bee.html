            <p> 
                Popular water fall Bee Fall is situated at Pachmarhi Hill Station in the Central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Pachmarhi is a tourist spot on Satpura Hills. Although Pachmarhi is home to several waterfalls, Bee Fall is regarded as the most well-known and a must-see destination for tourists. Pachmarhi is a well-liked travel location for citizens of the country. All year long, there are tourism activities available here. It is a naturally occurring waterfall located far below a valley that can be accessed by jeep and then footpaths.

                There are several water falls in and around Pachmarhi, but none compare to Bee Falls, where the waters of a perennial stream cascade 35 meters to the ground, providing visitors with an amazing view. Bee Falls is unique because it features a narrow stream of water that falls from a great height and appears to be melting silver. For individuals who have always loved the outdoors and the feeling of being in close proximity to Mother Nature, visiting during the summer months may prove to be a fortunate time to visit.
