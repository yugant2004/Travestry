            <li><h2>Banaras</h2>
            <p>Varanasi (Vārāṇasī), also known as Benares, Banaras (Banāras), or Kashi, is a northern Indian city on the Ganges river that plays a significant role in Hindu customs related to death, sorrow, and pilgrimage. The city's religious tourism is supported by a syncretic history of Muslim artisanship.Varanasi is situated on the left side of the river and is part of the middle-Ganges valley in the southeast of the state of Uttar Pradesh. It is located 320 kilometers (200 km) southeast of Lucknow, the state capital, and 692 kilometers (430 mi) southeast of New Delhi, the capital of India. It is located 121 kilometers (75 mi) downstream of Prayagraj, another important Hindu pilgrimage place, at the Yamuna River's confluence.
            </p>
            <p>One of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world is Varanasi. Its former name, Kashi, was linked to a 2,500-year-old kingdom of the same name. It has been suggested that the Ashoka Lion capital, located close to Sarnath, is a memorial to the Buddha's first sermon delivered there in the fifth century BCE. Adi Shankara made Shiva worship an official sect in Varanasi around the eighth century. In Varanasi, Tulsidas penned his epic poem in the Awadhi language, the Ramcharitmanas, a Bhakti movement reworking of the Sanskrit Ramayana. Many people in the area work in the tourism industry, silk weaving, carpet and craft industries, and Bharat Heavy Electricals and Banaras Locomotive Works. The city is renowned across the globe for having a large number of ghats, or stairs that descend a steep riverbank to the water where pilgrims carry out rites. The Dashashwamedh, Panchganga, Manikarnika, and Harishchandra Ghats—the latter two being the places where Hindus cremate their deceased—are particularly noteworthy. This is where the Hindu genealogical registers of Varanasi are stored. The Durga Temple, Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple, and Shiva's Kashi Vishwanath Temple are a few of Varanasi's well-known temples.
