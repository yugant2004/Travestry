            <p>Devalsari is located in the Aglar Valley in Tehri Garhwal, approximately 55 kilometers from Mussoorie, Uttarakhand, and is recognized for being a relatively untouched place that is also a nature lover's delight. Devalsari draws large groups of those seeking adventure and tranquility because of its surrounding majestic mountains and verdant meadows.
                It is well known for its varied flora and fauna, which includes more than 60 kinds of birds and over 70 species of vibrant butterflies. Trekking is another activity that may be done here in addition to bird watching and butterfly viewing. The journey to Nag Tibba, commonly referred to as the Serpent Peak, begins from Devalsari.

                Surrounded by towering deodar trees, the well-known Shiva Temple in Devalsari is thought to have been constructed in the 1600s. While there were no deodar forests in the area six hundred years ago, jowari was grown there. The communities of Pujaldi, Bangseel, Kinsu, and Theek owned the land.
               <p> History: Jaunpur is located in Uttarakhand's Tehri Garhwal area. The cuisine, attire, language, and culture of the Jaunpuris are deeply ingrained in tradition. Visitors are well received and treated by the Jaunpuris. They are renowned for holding both huge and little events all year round. The folk dances of Jaunpur, known as raansu and tandi, are well-known.</p>
