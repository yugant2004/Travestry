            <p>Hindu shrine Surkanda Devi is located close to Kanatal, Uttarakhand, India. Situated at an approximate elevation of 2756 meters, it is in close proximity to the surrounding hill stations of Dhanaulti (8 km [5.0 mi]) and Chamba (22 km [14 mi]). It is approximately 3 km [1.9 mi] by foot from Kaddukhal, the vehicle parking area.

                It offers a picturesque perspective over the surrounding area, which includes the Himalayas to the north and several cities to the south (such as Dehradun and Rishikesh), and is encircled by deep forests. Every year in May and June, a large number of people attend the Ganga Dusshera event. There is a temple located amidst the Rounslii trees. Fog blankets it for the most of the year.
                
            </p>
           <p> Mussoorie is a stop on the Dehradun route. Kaddukhal hamlet is where the motorable road stops. There is parking accessible in Kaddukhal. There is a 1.5 km journey to this temple from there. Trekking takes roughly two hours and is rather steep. In the event that walking is not an option, horses are also available. Beginning in April 2022, the ropeway service has also been launched.</p>

                <h3 class="below">History</h3>
            <li class="below">The narrative of Sati, the daughter of the Puranic god-king Daksha and the bride of the austere god Shiva, is one of the most enduring myths surrounding the beginning of worship at the location. Daksha was not thrilled with his daughter's husband choice, therefore he did not invite Shiva or Sati to participate in a large Vedic sacrifice for all the gods. </li>
            <li class="below">Sati hurled herself onto the flames, aware that doing so would contaminate the offering. At that very time, Sati, the all-powerful mother goddess, departed her body to take on the form of the goddess Parvati.
            </li>
            <li class="below">Shiva, meantime, was overcome with anger and anguish over his wife's passing. He took Sati's body and draped it over his shoulder, threatening to continue his tandava (dance of cosmic destruction) throughout the heavens until the body withered away completely.</li>
            <li class="below">Fearing for their own destruction, the other Gods begged Vishnu to appease Shiva. Vishnu so followed Shiva wherever he went while dancing.</li>
            <li class="below">Sudarshana, Lord Vishnu's discus, was dispatched to demolish Sati's corpse. Shiva was left without a body to bear as pieces of her body fell away. </li>
            <li class="below">There are 51 fragments of Sati's body strewn all over the Indian subcontinent, according to numerous stories and traditions. These locations, which honor several strong goddesses, are known as shakti peethas. Shiva dropped Sati's head at the location of the current Sarkunda Devi or Surkhanda Devi temple, which is today known as Sarkunda, when he was traveling over this area on his route back to Kailash carrying Sati's body.</li>
